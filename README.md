Data Science Getting and Cleaning Data Course - Project

To create a tidy data set based on the “UCI HAR” dataset, load and run the R script “run_analysis.R” which does the following:
- Loads the 'plyr' library
- Downloads the data from
  [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.html) and creates a data directory if it doesn't exist.
- Merges the training and test data.
- Generates descriptive activity names.
- Calculates the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
- Labels the columns with descriptive names
- Creates a new independent tidy dataset. The tidy data set is also exported as .txt file.


Please see the CodeBook.md file for further description of the data
